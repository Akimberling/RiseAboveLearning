# RiseAboveLearning

Abstract

The purpose of this project is to develop a web application that allows teachers to quiz students on different topics. This web application uses a relational database management system, MySQL. The data in the database is organized in a way that a user is related to quizzes and categories and each category is related to many quizzes(quizzes can also be related to many categories, it is a many to many relationship). The users consist of students and teachers who are differentiated by their permissions. The teachers manage everything including all user permissions, quizzes, and categories and the students may only add a category they would like a teacher to add quizzes to and take quizzes. This web application includes password protected administration capabilities that include: viewing, adding, editing, and deleting quizzes or categories. These capabilities all belong to the teachers and a few of them to the students such as adding and editing the categories that they created. The website also has a quiz taking page associated with each topic such as physics or history. The website includes a variety of other pages including a home page, about, Q&A, and a contact page. This website is developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and jQuery.
